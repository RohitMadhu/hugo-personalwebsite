      <description>This is the first post on the site. I was going to create a single html web page but then I decided against it for sheer laziness. Hugo will serve as the Static Site Generator (SSG) for this webpage as it seemed really well supported and easy to use. I am going to be using this site to document some personal projects that I am going to be working on, when I have the time.</description>

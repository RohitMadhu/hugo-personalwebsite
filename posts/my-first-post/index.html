I am going to be using this site to document some personal projects that I am going to be working on, when I have the time. I hope
that I can continue to make these posts but I will create a post documenting the ideas that I have - I think its easier to come up
with these ideas but the hardest part is working through them to the finish. This site will serve as a means for forcing me to get
things done.</p>
